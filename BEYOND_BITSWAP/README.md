# Project: Beyond Bitswap

## Motivation & Vision

File-transfer is at the core of IPFS and every subsystem inside IPFS is built to enable it in a fast and secure way, while maintaining certain guarantees (e.g. discoverability, data integrity and so on).

There are a thousand ways to slice a file into pieces and how to transfer it over the wire. However, finding what is the optimal way for the runtime (high powered, low powered device) and network conditions (stable, unstable, remote, offline) is the key challenge.

In high level, this project is about:
* Continuing the previous work on Block Exchange (i.e. Bitswap) and Graph Exchange (i.e. GraphSync)
* Creating a harness that enables to reproducibly run tests that demonstrate the performance of different file-transfer strategies.
* Research and prototype new strategies to acquire new speed ups.
* Acquire leverage by exposing the harness to the whole Open Source and Research community, in a way that others feel compelled to join the effort and try their own strategies.

In short, the aim of the project is two-fold: to drive speed-ups in file-sharing for IPFS and other P2P networks; and to enable a framework for anyone to join the quest of designing, implementing and evaluating brand new file-sharing strategies in P2P networks. 

## Why the project code name?

Bitswap has been for some time the file-sharing subsystem within IPFS, then Graphsync came to propose a new way of approaching file-sharing on IPFS. The scope of the project is not only to improve Bitswap's performance, but file-sharing in P2P networks as a whole. We don't restrict ourselves exlusively to Bitswap or IPFS for our exploration.

Being said that, the fact that IPFS had an infrastructure in place to start testing our ideas, and Bitswap being its file-sharing module, made us start our initial explorations over Bitswap and IPFS, but our aim is to go way farther and improve file-sharing performance with new protocols and proposals every P2P network can leverage and benefit from. In short, we want to go "Beyond Bitswap". The project can be considered a success if by the end of it one has a set of pluggable protocols and modules to achieve file-sharing in P2P environments, along with all the testbeds, tools and benchmarks required to improve this protocols and go _"Beyond Bitswap"_.

### Enhancement RFCs

This section shares a list of improvement RFCs that are being currently tackled, discussed and prototyped. Each RFC aims to test a specific idea or assumption, and they may initially be implemented over Bitswap, but that doesn't mean the conclusions drawn are exclusively applicable to the Bitswap protocol. RFCs are divided in the different layers for file-sharing in P2P sytems identified in the [Related Work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14AE8OJvSpkhguq2k1Gfc9h0JvorvLgOUSVrj3CnOkQk/edit#heading=h.nxkc23tlbqhl).

If you want to familiarize with our work, we highly recommend exploring first the RFCs in `prototype` state, and then move to the ones at a `draft` or `brainstorm` state. `prototyped` RFCs are in a stage where there is working prototype you can start evaluating and playing with. The `draft` state means that the RFC is ready for implementation, while `brainstorm` RFCs require further discussions and design work.
